//Format: TODO + PRIORITY/NUMBER
API is the nextttttt one
Implement spring?

Make a greeter message when logging in
Change primary key so its standalone, needs to be a sequence instead of autoincrement, make a seperate ID for students.
-- Search for students via name, not ID.
-- dont output studentID in lists!! needs to be hidden away..

TODO: DO THIS FIRST

Fix Student variables - brug GENDER enum som i https://stackabuse.com/guide-to-jpa-with-hibernate-basic-mapping/

Usermapper doesnt work!

Fix bugs in studentoutput, check the mapper...

if you login as admin, go to secretary menu, maybe make an option to go back?

maybe counter for login screen, 3 attempts for login?

Fix lists for getting single variables instead of everything in controller (for listfunctions, idchecker)

Maybe add a forgot password function or something??

Unique fix? Hvis to hedder det samme etc.
