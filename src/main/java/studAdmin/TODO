//Format: TODO + PRIORITY/NUMBER
API is the nextttttt one
Implement spring?

Make a greeter message when logging in
Change primary key so its standalone, needs to be a sequence instead of autoincrement, make a seperate ID for students.
-- Search for students via name, not ID.
-- dont output studentID in lists!! needs to be hidden away

TODO: DO THIS FIRST

Fix Student variables - brug GENDER enum som i https://stackabuse.com/guide-to-jpa-with-hibernate-basic-mapping/
-- ogs√• implement birthdate/birthyear som LocalDate instead. evt tag fra El Dolphin

Usermapper doesnt work!

Fix bugs in studentoutput, check the mapper...

need a not null checker for verification PW

maybe counter for login screen, 3 attempts for login?

Fix lists for getting single variables instead of everything in controller (for listfunctions, idchecker)

Maybe add a forgot password function or something??

Unique fix? Hvis to hedder det samme etc.
