# StudentAdminWDB README

Welcome to my Student Administration program.

This program is developed from a school project in 1st semester that I decided to take further and make my hobby project, which ended up being a
couple of months work, improving it as I learned more. Furthermore I also used it as a learning resource, to get better at programming.

Some of the main features include:
- Login system, with salt and HASH of passwords
- Database-stored information, with mySQL and Hibernate.
  - Database functions are encapsulated.
- Admin menu (u: admin, pw: admin)
- Secretary menu (u: secretary, pw: secretary)
  - Able to add, delete and edit students
  - Able to get multiple lists from different parameters
  - List total amount of students in the system
- Dynamic menu-UI

If you were to use the program, it would require you to make a local mySQL database and manually add all the tables since I used a local database myself.
